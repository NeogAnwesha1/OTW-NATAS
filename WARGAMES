        - After logging to 0 level it says " You can find the password for the next level on this page. "
        - WE VIEW THE PAGE SOURCE, again asked to login to level 0
        - <!--The password for natas1 is g9D9cREhslqBKtcA2uocGHPfMZVzeFK6 -->
        
# LEVEL 1 - LEVEL 2
        - After logging to 1st level it says "You can find the password for the next level on this page, but rightclicking has been blocked! "
        - So to view the page source we use " CTRL+U"
        - <!--The password for natas2 is h4ubbcXrWqsTo7GGnnUMLppXbOogfBZ7 -->
        
 # LEVEL 2 - LEVEL 3
        - After logging to 2nd level it says "There is nothing on this page "
        - So view the page source and find " <img src="files/pixel.png"> "
        - after opening that URL " view-source:http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files/ ", we get a "users.txt" file
        - upon opening users.txt we get the req password.
        - natas3:G6ctbMJ5Nb4cbFwhpMPSvxGHhQ7I6W8Q.
        
# LEVEL 3 - LEVEL 4
        - After logging to 3rd level it says "There is nothing on this page "
        - So view the page source and find " <!-- No more information leaks!! Not even Google will find it this time... --> "
        - So we use the "robots.txt" extension to get the inaccesible sites.
        - User-agent: *
          Disallow: /s3cr3t/
        - adding /s3cr3t/ to the url we get the another "users.txt " file wghich stores the req password.
        - natas4:tKOcJIbzM4lTs8hbCmzn5Zr4434fGZQm
        
       
 # LEVEL 4 - LEVEL 5
        - After logging to 4th level it says "Access disallowed. You are visiting from "" while authorized users should come only from "http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/"  "
        - So we got " inspect -> network -> edit and resend. "
        - We change the referer to " http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/" 
        - after forwarding the request we get " Access granted. The password for natas5 is Z0NsrtIkJoKALBCLi5eqFfcRN82Au2oD "
        
       
 # LEVEL 5 - LEVEL 6
        - After logging to 5th level it says " Access disallowed. You are not logged in. "
        - So we got " inspect -> network -> edit and resend. "
        - We see that under request header " loggedin = 0 " which we change to 1
        - after forwarding the request we get " Access granted. The password for natas6 is fOIvE0MDtPTgRhqmmvvAOt2EfXR6uQgR "
        
# LEVEL 6 - LEVEL 7
        - After logging to 6th level it says " Input secret: "
        - So we view "source code"
        - There we find a file included "includes/secret.inc"
        - after adding it to the URL we get a blank page. So we check the sourcecode of this page.
        - There we get " $secret = "FOEIUWGHFEEUHOFUOIU"; " and we input it to the  secret button"
        - Finally we get, " Access granted. The password for natas7 is jmxSiH3SP6Sonf8dv66ng8v1cIEdjXWr "
        
# LEVEL 7 - LEVEL 8
        - After logging to 7th level it gives two links "Home" "About"
        - Link "Home" returns " this is the front page "
        - Link "About" returns " this is the about page  "
        - On checking the source code, it hinted that " hint: password for webuser natas8 is in /etc/natas_webpass/natas8 "
        - After the command injection,  we get the password " a6bZCNYwdKqN5cGP11ZdtPg0iImQQhAB " 
        
 # LEVEL 8 - LEVEL 9
        - After logging to 8th level it asks " Input secret: "
        - On checking the source code, it shows that secret is encoded.
        " encodedSecret = "3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362";
          function encodeSecret($secret) {
                    return bin2hex(strrev(base64_encode($secret)));
                                        }
          if(array_key_exists("submit", $_POST)) {
                    if(encodeSecret($_POST['secret']) == $encodedSecret) {
                    print "Access granted. The password for natas9 is <censored>";
                    } else {
                    print "Wrong secret";
                    }
                   } "
        - So we decode try decode the secret, " php -a
                                                Interactive mode enabled   
                                                php > echo base64_decode(strrev(hex2bin('3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362')));
                                                oubWYf2kBq "
        - Finally we get the password, " Access granted. The password for natas9 is Sda6t0vkOPkM8YeOZkAGVhFoaplvlJFd "

# LEVEL 9 - LEVEL 10
        - After logging to 9th level it says " Find words containing: "
        - So we view to its source code, and found that when we enter a keyword, it is passed via a function called ' passthru() ". It takes the value in " $key " and executes it directly. "
        - So, we use (;) to execute multiple commands.
        - writing "; cat " only gives a set of words in alphabetical order.
        - So we use " ; cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10 " to get the password
        - The req passwords is : D44EcsFkLxPIkAAKLosx8z3hxX1Z4MCE
        
# LEVEL 10 - LEVEL 11
        - After logging to 10th level it says " For security reasons, we now filter on certain characters. Find words containing:  "
        - So we view to its source code.
        - found that when we enter a keyword, it is passed via a function called " passthru() ". It takes the value in " $key " and it filters the input of the characters " ;,|,& " 
        - Since we cannot use ";", we use " .* " to execute multiple commands
        - Using " .*/etc/natas_webpass/natas11 " we get req password. 
        - " /etc/natas_webpass/natas11:1KFqoJXi6hRaPluAmk8ESDW4fSysRoIg "
